Consider training neural networks on 500 pixel by 500 pixel images.
– So the number of inputs ‘d’ to first layer is 250,000 inputs.
• If first layer has k=10,000, then ‘W’ has 2.5 billion parameters.
We want to avoid this huge number (due to storage and overfitting).
• CNNs drastically reduce the number of parameters.
– Main way they do this is using layers that look like convolutions:
CNNs give some amount of translation invariance:
– Because same filters used across the image, they can detect a pattern anywhere in the image.
• Even in image locations where the pattern has never been seen.
