Gradient descent costs O(ndt) to run for ‘t’ iterations.
Cost of gradient descent iteration is O(nd) (no need to form XTX).
Overall cost is O(nd2 + d3).
Normal equations cost O(nd2 + d3).\n– Gradient descent costs O(ndt) to run for ‘t’ iterations.\n• Each of the ‘t’ iterations costs O(nd).\n– Gradient descent can be faster when ‘d’ is very large:
