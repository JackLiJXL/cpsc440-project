Decision trees are simple programs consisting of
A nested sequence of “if-else” decisions based on the features (splitting rules)
A class label as a return value at the end of each sequence.
Decision trees: predicting a label using a sequence of simple rules.
Decision stumps: simple decision tree that is very fast to fit.
