We all pollute the environment. We do so not because we get some 
perverse satisfaction from polluting, but because activities that give us 
utility inevitably pollute. We do not drive our cars in order to dump carbon 
monoxide into the air but because we gain utility from the transportation 
and convenience cars provide. Firms pollute the environment if doing so 
allows them to produce goods and services at lower cost.
