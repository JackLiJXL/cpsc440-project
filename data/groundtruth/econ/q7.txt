“The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the 
largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount 
of hissing.” 
Economists, who do not typically deal with geese, cite two criteria for 
designing a tax system. The first is based on the ability of people to pay 
taxes and the second focuses on the benefits they receive from particular 
government services.
