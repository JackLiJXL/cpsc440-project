Consumer protection laws are generally based on one of two conceptual 
arguments. The first holds that consumers do not always know what is 
best for them. This is the view underlying government efforts to encourage 
the use of merit goods and discourage the use of demerit goods. The 
second suggests that consumers simply do not have sufficient information 
to make appropriate choices.
