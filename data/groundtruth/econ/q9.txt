The marginal decision rule states that an activity should be expanded if its 
marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost. The marginal benefit of this 
activity is the utility gained by spending an additional $1 on the good. The 
marginal cost is the utility lost by spending $1 less on another good. 
How much utility is gained by spending another $1 on a good? It is the 
marginal utility of the good divided by its price.
