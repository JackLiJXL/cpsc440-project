Those who demand, and are willing to pay the price for, high-quality, safe, 
warranted products can do so. But some argue that people who demand 
and prefer to pay (presumably) lower prices for lower-quality products 
that may have risks associated with their use should also be allowed to 
exercise this preference. By increasing the costs of goods, consumer 
protection laws may adversely affect the poor, who are forced to purchase 
higher-quality products; the rich would presumably buy higher-quality 
products in the first place.
