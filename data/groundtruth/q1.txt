While preconditioning is a general technique for Laplacian systems, its use originates in the work of Vaidya [86]. Using preconditioners, Vaidya obtained an ˜ O ((∆ n ) 1 . 75 log 1 / ε ) time Laplacian solver for graphs with maximum degree ∆ . Vaidya’s paper was never published and his ideas and their derivatives appear in the thesis [42]. Boman and Hendrickson [18] use low-stretch spanning trees constructed by Alon et al. [6] to obtain ε -approximate solutions to Laplacian systems roughly in m 3 / 2 log 1 / ε time. The main result of this section, Theorem 17.1, is from [81]. The ﬁrst polylog n stretch trees in near-linear-time were constructed by Elkin et al. [27]. Theorem 17.3 is originally from [1], and improvements can be found in [2]. An important open problem is to ﬁnd a simple proof of Theorem 17.3 (potentially with worse log factors).
