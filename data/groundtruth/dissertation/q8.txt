Further benchmarking of LiquidBayes can reveal additional insights into its strengths and weaknesses. 
We intend to perform experiments on cancer types other than Lymphoma to understand how LiquidBayes generalizes across cancers. 
In particular, we want to explore cancers with less aneuploidy, to investigate the utility of SNVS in our extended model. 
Due to time constraints, we were not able to run any experiments on real CTDNA data. 
This is an important task for future analyses.

In future work, we intend to add SNPS into LiquidBayes. 
SNPS enable us to obtain allele-specific read counts, potentially increasing LiquidBayesâ€™ predic-tion power and sensitivity. 
This requires extracting SNPS from DLP+ results and blending an additional SNPS component in the model.
