In both the synthetic and semi-realistic experiments, we did not observe any significant improvement from the extended model over the base model. 
This could be an artifact of our SNV processing procedure or experimental design. 
Our SNV processing only left 100-200 SNVS, which may not be enough to contribute any additional power in our framework (Section 2.1.2). 
Regarding our experiments, the CN profiles of our sample manifested aneuploidy, suggesting CN to explain much of the genetic variation among clones.

Furthermore, the variability of estimates decreased as the number of clones increased. 
We did not observe any significant difference in performance between the base and extended models. 
L1 and Relative L1 values for the extended model can be found in Table A.4.

For tumour fractions above 1e-3, the L1 was relatively small relative to the true clone proportion (Table 3.7). Boxplots and L1 values for the extended model are in Figure A.9 and Table A.5, respectively.
