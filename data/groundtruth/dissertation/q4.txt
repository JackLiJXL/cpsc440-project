However, single-cell sequencing methods traditionally rely on genome amplifica-tion, which leads to uneven coverage and allelic dropout[67][44]. 
We tackle this

issue by employing a unique library preparation method, DLP+, to mitigate these biases.

preamplification[36].
DLP+ distinguishes itself by performing shallow se-quencing of thousands of cells rather than deep sequencing of few cells. 
In DLP+, object recognition is used to assess cell state, quality and doublets. 
A tagmentationstep appends unique oligonucleotide barcodes to exposed DNA in each well for mapping reads back to their respective cells.
Then, rounds of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are performed on individual wells. 
DLP+ identifies clonal populations by clustering cells on their CN profiles. 
Briefly, UMAP[39] is applied to normalized raw copy number data from HMMcopy[34].
Next, the reduced data are clustered, where clusters represent clones. 
Then, cells in each cluster are merged to produce clone-level pseudo-bulk genomes.
