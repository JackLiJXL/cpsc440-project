Synthetic CN profiles were simulated using an Hidden Markov Model (HMM). 
We imposed 8 distinct states which corresponded to CN states 0-8. 
Each state had a self-loop and positive transition probabilities for two steps in either direction (e.g. state 3 can transition to one of 5 states: 1,2,3,4,5). 
We initialized the first CN state
14

to 2. Given the current state, we sampled from a Multinomial with transition proba-bilities [.005,.01,.97,.01,.005] using numpy.multinomial. 
Next, we indexed the vector [−2,−1,0,1,2] using the sampled value and added the indexed value to the current state to get the next state. 
The emission distribution was the identity.
The upper and lower bounds for the CN state were 8 and 0, respectively. 
Each syn-thetic CN profile contained 5000 bins and we treated CN profiles as independent.
Algorithm 1 presents pseudocode for this process. Figure 2.5 depicts simulated CN profiles for 3 clones.

Synthetic read counts were generated using a modified forward sampling (Sec-tion 1.5.2) procedure. 
In this setting, ρ was observed and did not need to be sam-pled. 
We computed ˆci, which was a measure of the expected proportion of total reads in bin i. 
The expected number of reads for a given coverage was determined by multiplying the size of the human genome by the desired coverage and dividing by the average read length. 
We set the size of the human genome to be 3×109 and the average read length to be 135. 
Then, we sampled from Multi(reads, ˆc) using numpy.multinomial to get our final dataset. 
Algorithm 2 describes the read count generation procedure. 
Figure 2.6 shows scatterplots of forward simulated read counts at various tumour fractions.

Simulating Allelic Counts
Synthetic allelic counts were produced by first sampling from a Beta(2,2) to
simulate VAFS for each site/clone pair (

l j
fl j , where l ∈ {1,2,...,250} and j ∈
{1,2,...,k}, k being the number of clones). Then, we computed ml j =
