SNVS describe the event where a single nucleotide is substituted at a specific genomic position[68]. This substitution can alter amino acid synthesis, disrupt protein function, and ultimately effect disease. 
In cancer, variants may confer selective advantages to a subpopulation of cells, promoting tumour growth[60]. 
These vari-ants are called ‘driver mutations’.
