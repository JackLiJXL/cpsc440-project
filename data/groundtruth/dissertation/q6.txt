Binned read counts were extracted from the CTDNA bam using readCounter from hmmcopy utils[33]. 
GC and mappability bias correction were applied using correctReadcount from HMMcopy[34]; GC and mappa-bility wig files were generated using gcCounter and mapCounter from hmm-
copy utils[33]. 
The copy column of the resultant dataframe contained normalized and corrected binned read counts.

Subsequently, we removed outliers from corrected and normalized binned read counts. We noted that the number of read counts across bins with identical bin-specific CN configurations should be normally distributed. 
Therefore, we grouped read counts according to bin-specific CN configurations; 
for each group, we fitted a two component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and removed read counts in the component with the higher covariance. 
Bin-specific CN configurations were ordered tuples of clonal and normal CN values. 
Possible CN configurations for a setting with two clones and a matched normal were {(2,2,2), (2,2,3), (4,3,2)}.
