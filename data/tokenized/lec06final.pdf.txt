Linear Programming
General Problem We are given a set of variables. We want to
assign real values to them so that:
1. They satisfy given linear equations and/or inequalities.
2. They maximize (or minimize) a given linear “objective”
function.
max x1 + 6x2
x1 ≤ 200
x2 ≤ 300
x1 + x2 ≤ 400
x1, x2 ≥ 0

Linear Programming
Optimum point exists unless
infeasible The feasible set is empty.
E.g. x1 < 1 and x1 > 3
unbounded The feasible set is unbounded (in the direction of
optimization).
E.g. max (x1 + x2) where x1, x2 ≥ 0.

Network Flows
A flow network is a directed graph G = (V , E) in which each
edge (u, v) ∈ E has a positive capacity c(u, v) (non-edges have
capacity 0).
G contains a source vertex s and a sink vertex t.
A flow is an assignment f of real numbers to edges of G:
1. 0 ≤ f (u, v) ≤ c(u, v)
2. For all v ̸= s, t : �
u f (u, v) = �
w f (v, w)
The size (or value) of a flow is: size(f ) = �
(s,v)∈E f (s, v)
Goal: Find flow with maximum size.
