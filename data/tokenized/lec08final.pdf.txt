Theorem: If residual network G f has no augmenting path then f is a max size flow. Proof: Let S = { v | s ⇝ v in G f } . The sink t ̸∈ S since G f has no augmenting path. Let T = V − S . Size of flow f = f ( S , T ) equals c ( S , T ) since f ( u , v ) = c ( u , v ) for u ∈ S , v ∈ T . Size of any flow ≤ c ( S , T ) by Lemma. □ Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem Size of max-flow f ∗ equals capacity of min capacity cut ( S ∗ , T ∗ ) . Proof: size( f ∗ ) ≤ c ( S ∗ , T ∗ ) by Lemma size( f ∗ ) = c ( S , T ) where S = { v | s ⇝ v in G f ∗ } and c ( S , T ) ≥ c ( S ∗ , T ∗ ) since ( S ∗ , T ∗ ) is min capacity cut. □ Integrality Theorem If all capacities are integers then there is a max-flow with integer flow on every edge.
