An augmenting path in G is an s ⇝ t path in G f



For flow networks ( V , E ) with integral capacities: Running time O ( | E | size( f ∗ ))

Lemma: The length d 1 ( s , v ) (# edges) of the shortest path in residual network G 1 from s to v cannot decrease in residual network G 2 after a shortest aug. path augmentation. Proof: Suppose d 1 ( s , v ) does decrease to d 2 ( s , v ) < d 1 ( s , v ). Pick such a v with smallest d 2 ( s , v ). Let u be the vertex before v in this shortest aug. path in G 2 ( v ̸ = s so u exists). d 2 ( s , v ) = d 2 ( s , u ) + 1 ≥ d 1 ( s , u ) + 1 u is closer to s ≥ d 1 ( s , v ) see (1) and (2) ⇒⇐ □ (1) If ( u , v ) ∈ G 1 then d 1 ( s , v ) ≤ d 1 ( s , u ) + 1 (2) If ( u , v ) ̸∈ G 1 then augmentation created ( u , v ) in G 2 G 1 s v u t This is a shortest aug. path so d 1 ( s , u ) = d 1 ( s , v ) + 1 and d 1 ( s , u ) > d 1 ( s , v )

A bipartite graph is a graph G = ( V , E ) where V can be partitioned into A and B such that ∀ ( u , v ) ∈ E , either u ∈ A and v ∈ B or u ∈ B and v ∈ A .

Given bipartite graph G = ( V , E ) with partitions A and B : 1. Create a flow network F = ( V ′ , E ′ ) V ′ = V ∪ { s , t } add source E ′ = { ( u , v ) | u ∈ A , v ∈ B , ( u , v ) ∈ E } edges from ∪ { ( s , u ) | u ∈ A } edges from ∪ { ( v , t ) | v ∈ B } edges from Set all capacities to 1. 2.
