A mixture (aka convex combination ) of points p 1 , . . . , p n is n i =1 α i p i where α i ≥ 0 and i,
 i α i = 1. For n = 2 points, the set of convex combinations is the line segment between

The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all

The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all convex sets that contain P .

CH( P )

The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all convex sets that contain P . A point p ∈ P is on the boundary of CH( P ) iff there exists a line ℓ through p with all P on one side of ℓ . CH( P )

The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all convex sets that contain P .

Idea: Tie a string to a point p 1 ∈ P that is on the CH ( P ). Rotate a taut string around the points until it ”bends” at the next point on CH ( P ). Keep go- ing until back to p 1 .
