Homework Collaboration
You may discuss problems in a group of fellow 420 students of size
at most three. However you must write your submission on your
own. At the top of the first page of your submission, you must
acknowledge all resources that you used, including books, websites,
and students who helped. Submissions missing this statement will
not be graded.

Topics
▶ Geometric algorithms: Convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams
▶ Linear programming: Network Flow, Zero-sum games
▶ Online algorithms: Page replacement
▶ Dynamic programming
▶ NP-hardness: Approximation algorithms, Hardness of
approximation
▶ Compression: Huffman, Lempel-Ziv
▶ (maybe) Fast Fourier Transform
▶ (maybe) Quantum computation
8 / 13

Goals of the Course
▶ Become more familiar with algorithm design techniques
▶ Explore optimizing other measures of an algorithm’s
performance (compression, paging, ...)
▶ Determine when improving an algorithm is hopeless
▶ Explore ways to find approximate solutions (and when that’s
hopeless)

Making mixtures
B = (9, 21)
A = (15, 36)
C = (12, 33)
X = (13, 31)
Y = (12, 30)
A mixture (aka convex combination)
of points p1, . . . , pn is
n
�
i=1
αipi
where αi ≥ 0 and �
i αi = 1.
For n = 2 points, the set of convex
combinations is the line segment between
them.
For n = 3, it’s the triangle with those
points as vertices.

Convex Hull
A set S is convex if for all a, b ∈ S the segment ab is in S.
The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all
convex sets that contain P.
CH(P)
12 / 13

Convex Hull
A set S is convex if for all a, b ∈ S the segment ab is in S.
The convex hull of a set P of points is the intersection of all
convex sets that contain P.
A point p ∈ P is on the boundary of
CH(P) iff there exists a line ℓ through
p with all P on one side of ℓ.
CH(P)

Jarvis March (Gift-wrapping)
Idea: Tie a string to a point p1 ∈ P
that is on the CH(P). Rotate a taut
string around the points until it ”bends”
at the next point on CH(P). Keep go-
ing until back to p1.
Turn test
Path a → b → c makes a left turn at b iff
