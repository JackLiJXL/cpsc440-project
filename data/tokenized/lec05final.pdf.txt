This algorithm finds both VorD and CH of S . 0. Sort sites by x -coord VorD+CHull ( S ) 1. if | S | = 1 return VorD = ∅ and CHull = [ s 1 ] 2. if | S | = 2 return VorD = ⊥ -bisector of s 1 s 2 and CHull = [ s 1 s 2 ] 3. Recursively find VorD L and CHull L of s 1 , . . . , s n / 2 4. Recursively find VorD R and CHull R of s n / 2+1 , . . . , s n 5. Merge CHull L and CHull R to get CHull 6. Stitch together VorD L and VorD R to get VorD 7. Return VorD and CHull

See your Homework 1 for a (more general) O ( n ) time solution. The two blue lines are the upper and lower bridges.

Stitch together VorD L and VorD R 2 1 3 4 5 1. Let pq be upper bridge 2. Find intersection of ⊥ pq with edge of VorD L ( p ) and VorD R ( q ) 3. If ⊥ pq intersects ⊥ pp ′ before ⊥ qq ′ then p = p ′ else q = q ′ 4. Repeat until pq is lower bridge Note: Step 2 can be done by scanning edges of VorD L ( p ) cw and VorD R ( q ) ccw (no backtracking).
