Voronoi Diagram using Divide and Conquer [Shamos & Hoey ’75]
This algorithm finds both VorD and CH of S.
0. Sort sites by x-coord
VorD+CHull(S)
1. if |S| = 1 return VorD = ∅ and CHull = [s1]
2. if |S| = 2 return VorD =⊥ -bisector of s1s2 and CHull = [s1s2]
3. Recursively find VorDL and CHullL of s1, . . . , sn/2
4. Recursively find VorDR and CHullR of sn/2+1, . . . , sn
5. Merge CHullL and CHullR to get CHull
6. Stitch together VorDL and VorDR to get VorD
7. Return VorD and CHull

See your Homework 1 for a (more general) O(n) time solution.
The two blue lines are the upper and lower bridges.

1. Let pq be upper bridge
2. Find intersection of ⊥ pq with
edge of VorDL(p) and VorDR(q)
3. If ⊥ pq intersects ⊥ pp′ before
⊥ qq′ then p = p′ else q = q′
4. Repeat until pq is lower bridge
Note: Step 2 can be done by scanning edges of VorDL(p) cw and
VorDR(q) ccw (no backtracking).

Linear Programming
General Problem We are given a set of variables. We want to
assign real values to them so that:
1. They satisfy given linear equations and/or inequalities.
2. They maximize (or minimize) a given linear “objective”
function.

Linear Programming
Optimum point exists unless
infeasible The feasible set is empty.
E.g. x1 < 1 and x1 > 3
unbounded The feasible set is unbounded (in the direction of
optimization).
E.g. max (x1 + x2) where x1, x2 ≥ 0.
