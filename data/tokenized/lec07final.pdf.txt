Network Flows
A flow network is a directed graph G = (V , E) in which each
edge (u, v) ∈ E has a positive capacity c(u, v) (non-edges have
capacity 0).
G contains a source vertex s and a sink vertex t.
A flow is an assignment f of real numbers to edges of G:
1. For all u, v: 0 ≤ f (u, v) ≤ c(u, v) capacity constraint
2. For all v ̸= s, t : �
u f (u, v) = �
w f (v, w) flow conservation
The size (or value) of a flow is: size(f ) = �
(s,v)∈E f (s, v)
Goal: Find flow with maximum size.

The residual network of flow network G = (V , E) with flow f is
G f = (V , E f ) where
E f = {(u, v)|f (u, v) < c(u, v) or f (v, u) > 0}
The residual capacity of an edge (u, v) ∈ E f is
cf (u, v) =
�
c(u, v) − f (u, v)
if f (u, v) < c(u, v)
f (v, u)
if f (v, u) > 0
An augmenting path in G is an s ⇝ t path in G f

Correctness of Ford & Fulkerson
A cut is a partition (S, T) of V such that s ∈ S and t ∈ T. (Cut
separates s from t.)
The capacity of cut (S, T) is c(S, T) =
�
u∈S,v∈T
c(u, v)
The flow across cut (S, T) is f (S, T) =
�
u∈S,v∈T
f (u, v)
Lemma
For any flow f and any cut (S, T), size(f ) = f (S, T) ≤ c(S, T)
Proof outline
1. f (S, T) ≤ c(S, T)
[Capacity Constraint]
2. f (S, T) = f (S − {v}, T + {v})
[Flow Conservation]
3. f ({s}, V − {s}) = size(f )

Theorem
If residual network G f has no augmenting path then f is a max
size flow.
Proof: Let S = {v|s ⇝ v in G f }. The sink t ̸∈ S since G f has no
augmenting path. Let T = V − S. Size of flow f = f (S, T) equals
c(S, T) since f (u, v) = c(u, v) for u ∈ S, v ∈ T. Size of any flow
≤ c(S, T) by Lemma.
□
Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
Size of max-flow f ∗ equals capacity of min capacity cut (S∗, T ∗).
Proof: size(f ∗) ≤ c(S∗, T ∗) by Lemma
size(f ∗) = c(S, T) as defined by S = {v|s ⇝ v in G f ∗
c(S, T) ≥ c(S∗, T ∗) since (S∗, T ∗) is min capacity cut.} and
