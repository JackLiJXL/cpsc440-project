X = Fast input transform c -approxTSP( G ) A Graph G = ( V , E ) G , w T/F Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm Y = Fast output transform Q weightedgraph Transform X : G ′ is complete graph on V . w ( u , v ) = 1 if ( u , v ) ∈ E c | V | + 1 otherwise Transform Y : If | Q | ≤ c | V | then output “T” else output “F” Why does this work? Edges not in the original graph are so costly that there is a gap between cost of tour if G contains Ham Cycle (cost = | V | ) versus when it does not (cost > c | V | ). A c -approx. alg is sensitive
