Approximating ∆TSP [Christofides ’76]
MinTSP: Given graph G with positive weights on the edges, find a
Hamiltonian cycle of minimum total weight
∆TSP is MinTSP where the edge weights obey the triangle
inequality: w(a, c) ≤ w(a, b) + w(b, c) for all vertices a, b, c.
1. Let T be a Minimum Spanning Tree of G.
2. Let M be a min length complete matching in the complete
graph on odd degree vertices of T.
3. Let E be Euler tour in T ∪ M.
4. Eliminate repeated vertices in E to get approx TSP.

Hardness of Approximation
Claim: General TSP is NP-hard to approximate within a constant
factor.
Proof: Suppose A is a polytime c-approximation algorithm for
general TSP. We show how to use A to solve Ham. Cycle (an
NP-hard decision problem) in polytime.

otherwise
Transform Y : If |Q| ≤ c|V | then output “T” else output “F”
Why does this work?
Edges not in the original graph are so costly that there is a gap
between cost of tour if G contains Ham Cycle (cost = |V |) versus
when it does not (cost > c|V |). A c-approx. alg is sensitive
enough to detect this difference.
