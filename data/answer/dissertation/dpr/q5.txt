 The extended model of LiquidBayes significantly outperformed both ichorCNA and MRDetectSNV at all tumour fractions. The gap in accuracy between LiquidBayes and the other two models grew larger as the tumour fraction decreased. MCMC samples from LiquidBayesâ€™ base and extended models showed short HDI widths, with none containing the true tumour fraction. The HDI widths steadily declined as the tumour fraction decreased. The error increased moderately when the smallest clone was removed, but increased considerably when the largest clone was removed.
