 The novelty of the LiquidBayes base and extended models is that they are able to accurately estimate the tumour fraction and clone fractions even when a clone is missing in the tissue biopsy. This is demonstrated in the semi-realistic setting in Section 3.1.4 for removing clones, where LiquidBayes outperformed all other methods even when the smallest clone was removed. This is further supported by the results in Figure A.13 and Table A.4, which show that LiquidBayes gave better estimates than the other models even when the largest clone was removed.
