 We can synthesize read counts, copy number profiles and allelic counts by using a modified forward sampling procedure. This procedure involves computing the expected proportion of total reads in a given bin, multiplying the size of the human genome by the desired coverage and dividing by the average read length, and then sampling from Multi(reads, ˆc) using numpy.multinomial to get the final dataset. For synthesizing allelic counts, we first sample from a Beta(2,2) to simulate VAFS for each site/clone pair, and then compute ml j = f ′l jfl j cq j, cqj being generated by the process described in Section 2.2.1.
