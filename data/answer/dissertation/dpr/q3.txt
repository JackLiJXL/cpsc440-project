 Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are events where a single nucleotide is substituted at a specific genomic position. This substitution can alter amino acid synthesis, disrupt protein function, and ultimately affect disease. SNVs are commonly studied for the purpose of prognosis evaluation and treatment response. Variant calling is the process of discerning genomic positions that harbor mutations.
