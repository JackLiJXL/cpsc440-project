 The Direct Library Preparation+ (DLP+) method is a scalable single-cell library preparation method without preamplification that can address the issues induced from single-cell sequencing. DLP+ distinguishes itself by performing shallow sequencing of thousands of cells rather than deep sequencing of few cells. In DLP+, object recognition is used to assess cell state, quality and doublets. A tagmentation step appends unique oligonucleotide barcodes to exposed DNA in each well for mapping reads back to their respective cells. Then, rounds of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are performed on individual wells. DLP+ identifies clonal populations by clustering cells on their CN profiles.
