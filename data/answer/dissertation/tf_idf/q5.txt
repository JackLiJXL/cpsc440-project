 The extended model of LiquidBayes performed well in the synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. Figure 3.4 shows that the read depth was inversely related to error, and the variance of Relative L1 losses was more volatile at read depths less than .5x than at read depths greater than .5x. Furthermore, the variability of estimates decreased as the number of clones increased. Table A.4 shows the L1 and Relative L1 values for the extended model, and Figures 3.7 and A.4 show the posterior plots of MCMC samples from the base and extended models, respectively.
