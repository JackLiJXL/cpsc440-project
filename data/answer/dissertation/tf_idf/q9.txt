 We synthesize read counts by using a modified forward sampling procedure. We compute ˆci, which is a measure of the expected proportion of total reads in bin i. We then sample from Multi(reads, ˆc) using numpy.multinomial to get our final dataset. We synthesize allelic counts by first sampling from a Beta(2,2) to simulate VAFS for each site/clone pair. We then compute ml j = f ′l jfl j cq j, cqj being generated by the process described in Section 2.2.1. We model the number of mutant reads from CTDNA at site l (bl) using the Binomial Logit distribution. We synthesize copy number profiles by performing no additional preprocessing steps.
