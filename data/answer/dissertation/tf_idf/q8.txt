 One possible direction to extend this model and further improve the prediction accuracy is to incorporate SNVs alongside clone-specific CN profiles. This is because the extended model incorporates SNVs alongside clone-specific CN profiles, which can help to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, we can also explore other methods to model the mean parameter µi and scale parameter τ, such as using a Gaussian distribution instead of a Student's t-distribution. We can also explore other methods to model the Dirichlet parameter ρ, such as using a Gamma distribution instead.
