 We use the tool correctReadcount from HMMcopy to normalize the read count data and remove outliers. We noted that the number of read counts across bins with identical bin-specific CN configurations should be normally distributed. Therefore, we grouped read counts according to bin-specific CN configurations; for each group, we fitted a two component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and removed read counts in the component with the higher covariance.
