 Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) describe the event where a single nucleotide is substituted at a specific genomic position. This substitution can alter amino acid synthesis, disrupt protein function, and ultimately affect disease. In cancer, variants may confer selective advantages to a subpopulation of cells, promoting tumour growth. These variants are called ‘driver mutations’. Variant calling, the process whereby genomic positions that harbor mutations are discerned, is a common component in bioinformatics pipelines.
