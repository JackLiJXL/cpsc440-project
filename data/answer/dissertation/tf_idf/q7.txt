 The novelty of the LiquidBayes base model is that it leverages clone-specific CN profiles to enhance tumour fraction and clonal prevalence estimates. The graphical model for the base model includes k clones and n bins. The extended model incorporates SNVs alongside clone-specific CN profiles. The graphical model for the extended model includes k clones, n bins, and L shared SNV sites across all clones.
