 We use the L1 and Relative L1 losses to evaluate the accuracy of the tumor subclonal prevalence in the synthetic experiment. This is stated in Chapter 3, Results, 3.1 Synthetic Experiments, where it is mentioned that "We used the L1 and Relative L1 losses to evaluate accuracy." Numeric results for the extended model can be found in Table A.3. We also plotted MCMC samples from experiments on each read depth for tumour fractions 5e-3 and 1e-3 (Figure 3.5).
