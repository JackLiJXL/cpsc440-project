 To address the issues induced from single-cell sequencing, such as uneven coverage and allelic dropout, Direct Library Preparation Plus (DLP+) can be employed. DLP+ delivers single-cell resolution for precise deconvolution of both major and minor clonal populations and resolves clonal CNVS in low tumour burden settings. This is mentioned in the context in the sentence "We tackle this by employing Direct Library Preparation Plus (DLP+)(Section 1.3.2), delivering single-cell resolution for precise deconvolution of both major and minor clonal populations and resolving clonal CNVS in low tumour burden settings."
