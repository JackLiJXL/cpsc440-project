 One possible direction to extend this model and further improve the prediction accuracy is to include SNVs alongside CN profiles. This was proposed in the discussion section of the context, where it was mentioned that SNVs can provide additional insight into clone-level mechanisms of resistance in patients. Additionally, increasing the read depth could also improve the accuracy of the model, as seen in the results section of the context. This was observed in the experiments, where higher read depths improved LiquidBayes’ performance, whereas higher read depths did not affect ichorCNA or MRDetectSNV’s performance.
