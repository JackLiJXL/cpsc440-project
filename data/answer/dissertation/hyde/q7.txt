 The novelty of the LiquidBayes base and extended models is that they are able to accurately infer the prevalence of individual clonal populations in addition to the overall tumour fraction, even when the tumour fraction is as low as 1e-5. This is demonstrated in the synthetic experiments, where both models performed comparably and gave accurate predictions at tumour fractions greater than 1e-3. This is supported by the graphical models in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2, which show that the models take inputs of per-clone CN profiles from DLP+ and binned read counts from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of ctDNA, and output clone-specific and normal prevalence estimates.
