 Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are single nucleotide substitutions at a specific genomic position that can alter amino acid synthesis, disrupt protein function, and ultimately affect disease. SNVs are also known as driver mutations, and variant calling is the process of discerning genomic positions that harbor mutations. SNVs are an important part of genetic variation among individuals and can explain differences in disease susceptibility.
