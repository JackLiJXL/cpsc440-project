 We use the L1 and Relative L1 losses to evaluate the accuracy of the tumor subclonal prevalence in the synthetic experiment. This is stated in Chapter 3, Results, 3.1 Synthetic Experiments, where it is mentioned that "We used the L1 and Relative L1 losses to evaluate accuracy." This is further supported by Figure 3.1b and Table 3.2, which show the boxplots of logged relative-error of tumour and clone fraction estimates for six tumour fraction levels using the base model.
