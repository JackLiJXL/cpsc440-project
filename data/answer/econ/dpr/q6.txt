 Firms pollute the environment because it is often cheaper to do so than to invest in pollution control technology. Incentives are needed to eliminate this incentive to pollute, such as emissions taxes or marketable pollution permits. Emissions taxes are a policy that charges firms for their emissions, which increases their costs and reduces emissions. However, this policy does not provide incentives for firms to invest in pollution control technology, and it may be difficult to set the tax rate at the right level. Marketable pollution permits are a policy that allows firms to buy and sell the right to pollute the environment. This policy provides incentives for firms to invest in pollution control technology, but it may be difficult to set the initial number of permits at the right level.
