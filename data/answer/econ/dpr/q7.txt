 Economists are not related to geese or racoons. The text mentioned geese because it was quoting a proverb that used geese as a metaphor for taxation. The proverb states that the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing. This proverb is used to illustrate the idea that taxes should be designed in a way that takes the least amount of money from people while still providing the most benefit to the government.
