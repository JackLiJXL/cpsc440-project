 Consumer protection laws can adversely affect the poor by increasing the cost of goods and services. This is because these laws add to the cost of producing goods and services, which in turn boosts prices. This can be especially detrimental to the poor, who may not have the financial resources to pay for the increased cost of goods and services. Additionally, consumer protection laws can restrict the freedom of choice of individuals, some of whom may be willing to take more risks than others. This can limit the options available to the poor, who may not be able to afford the more expensive options that are available.
