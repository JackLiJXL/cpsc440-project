 We pollute the environment because activities that give us utility inevitably pollute. We do not drive our cars in order to dump carbon monoxide into the air but because we gain utility from the transportation and convenience cars provide. Therefore, our pollution is related to us driving our cars because the act of driving our cars produces pollution as a by-product.
