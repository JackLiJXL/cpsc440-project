 Consumer protection laws can adversely affect the poor by increasing the cost of goods and services, which can make them more expensive for the poor. This can restrict the freedom of choice of individuals, some of whom are willing to take more risks than others. By increasing the costs of goods, consumer protection laws may force the poor to purchase higher-quality products, while the rich would presumably buy higher-quality products in the first place. This can lead to a situation where the poor are unable to access the same quality of goods and services as the rich, which can lead to a widening of the gap between the two groups.
