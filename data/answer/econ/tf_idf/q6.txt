 Firms pollute the environment because doing so allows them to produce goods and services at lower cost. In order to eliminate pollution, incentives need to be put in place to make it more expensive for firms to pollute than to not pollute. An example of a policy that could be used to incentivize firms to reduce their pollution is an emissions tax. This policy would make it more expensive for firms to pollute by charging them for their emissions. However, this policy has its limitations, as firms may simply raise their prices and go on doing what they were doing before.
