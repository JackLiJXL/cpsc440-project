 Firms pollute the environment because it is often cheaper to do so than to invest in pollution control technology. Incentives are needed to encourage firms to reduce their emissions, such as emissions taxes or marketable pollution permits. Emissions taxes are a policy that can be used to reduce pollution. They work by imposing a tax on each unit of emissions, which encourages firms to reduce their emissions until the marginal benefit of emissions equals the tax. This creates a least-cost reduction in emissions. However, emissions taxes are limited in that they do not create an incentive for firms to search out new and cheaper ways to reduce emissions in the long run.
