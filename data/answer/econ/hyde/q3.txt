 Consumer protection laws can adversely affect the poor by increasing the cost of goods and services, thus boosting prices. This restricts the freedom of choice of individuals, some of whom are willing to take more risks than others. By increasing the costs of goods, consumer protection laws may force the poor to purchase higher-quality products, while the rich would presumably buy higher-quality products in the first place. This means that the poor are unable to exercise their preference for lower-quality products that may have risks associated with their use.
