 A dataset with k clusters where k-means cannot find the true clusters would be one with non-convex connected clusters, such as a dataset with clusters that are not circular or spherical in shape. K-means is not sensitive to initialization or outliers, but it is not suitable for finding non-convex connected clusters because it partitions space into convex sets. Density-based clustering is better suited for this type of dataset because it can “expand” and “merge” dense regions of points to find clusters.
