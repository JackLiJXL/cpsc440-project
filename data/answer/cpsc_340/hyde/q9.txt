 The top three factors to consider when building a neural network for images by ourselves are the number of inputs to the first layer, the number of parameters in the first layer, and the use of layers that look like convolutions. The number of inputs to the first layer should be considered because it affects the number of parameters in the first layer. The number of parameters in the first layer should be considered because it affects the storage and overfitting of the neural network. The use of layers that look like convolutions should be considered because it drastically reduces the number of parameters and allows for hidden units to depend on a small number of inputs.
