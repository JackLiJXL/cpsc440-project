 An ensemble method for feature selection that could improve the performance of this method is to use a "selected frequency" approach. This approach would involve applying the feature selection method to bootstrap samples of the training data and only taking the features selected in a certain number of the bootstrap samples. This would reduce the number of false negatives by allowing "relevant" variables to be included even if they don't reach the best value.
