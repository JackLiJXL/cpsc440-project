 We should consider using gradient descent to approximate the solution to the least squares problem instead of exactly solving it with the closed form solution when the cost of computing the gradient is linear in 'n' and 'd' is very large. This is because gradient descent can be faster when 'd' is very large, and if the solution is "good enough" for a 't' less than minimum(d,d2/n).
