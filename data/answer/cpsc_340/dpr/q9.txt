 The top 3 factors to consider when building a neural network for images by ourselves are automatic differentiation, convolutional neural networks, and the number of parameters. Automatic differentiation allows us to compute the gradient for the same cost as the objective function, but has some disadvantages compared to human-written code. Convolutional neural networks include layers that apply several (learned) convolutions, significantly decreasing the number of parameters, and achieving a degree of translation invariance. The number of parameters is important to consider when building a neural network, as it affects the complexity of the model.
