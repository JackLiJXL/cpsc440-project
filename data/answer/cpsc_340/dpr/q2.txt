 An ensemble method for feature selection that could improve the performance of this method would be to replace the "intersection" with "selected frequency". This means that instead of only selecting features that are selected in all bootstrap samples, the ensemble method would select features that are selected in a certain number of bootstrap samples. This would reduce the false negatives by allowing features that are selected in some bootstrap samples to be included in the selection.
