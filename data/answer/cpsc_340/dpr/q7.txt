 We should consider using gradient descent to approximate the solution to the least squares problem instead of exactly solving it with the closed form solution when the solution is "good enough" for a 't' less than minimum(d,d2/n) and when 'd' is very large. This is because gradient descent can be faster in this case, as it costs O(ndt) to run for 't' iterations, while the normal equations cost O(nd2 + d3).
