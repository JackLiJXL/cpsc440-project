 We can use a hybrid content/collaborative filtering algorithm such as SVDfeature to recommend movies to Al. This algorithm combines content-based and collaborative filtering by learning weights 'w' on fixed features xij and movie-specific weights wj on learned user-specific features zi. This allows more accurate predictions for users/movies with lots of data, including new users and movies.
