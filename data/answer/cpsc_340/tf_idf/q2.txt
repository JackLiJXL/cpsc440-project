 An ensemble method for feature selection that could improve the performance of this method is to use a bootstrap approach. This involves applying the feature selection method to bootstrap samples of the training data and only taking the features selected in all bootstrap samples. This would reduce the number of false negatives by increasing the number of features selected, as the feature selection method would be applied to multiple samples of the training data.
