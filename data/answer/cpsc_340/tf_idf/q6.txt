 A dataset with k clusters where k-means cannot find the true clusters would be a dataset with non-convex clusters. K-means is a partitioning clustering algorithm, meaning it divides the data into distinct, non-overlapping subsets. Non-convex clusters are clusters that are not defined by a line between two points in the set staying in the set, and thus cannot be divided into distinct, non-overlapping subsets. K-means is not able to separate these non-convex clusters, so it cannot find the true clusters in a dataset with non-convex clusters.
