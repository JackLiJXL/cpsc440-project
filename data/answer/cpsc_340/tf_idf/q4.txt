 You would use the L1-loss when you want to be robust to outlier data points, as it is more robust to outliers than other loss functions. You would use L1-regularization when you want to be robust to irrelevant features, as it is more robust to irrelevant features than other regularization techniques. This is because L1-regularization sets values to exactly 0, which helps to remove irrelevant features.
